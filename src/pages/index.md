  title: About Us
  description: >
    Wings of Hope Wildlife Sanctuary is dedicated to the professional treatment
    and care for native wild bird and mammal species that are injured, orphaned,
    or otherwise unable to care for themselves and return them to their native
    habitat.


    Wings of Hope fosters and promotes public knowledge, education and interest in Louisiana's native wildlife.
description: "  The beauty of wildlife should be viewed from afar, respected and
  allowed to survive in their native habitat. Some wild bird and mammal species
  that arrive at Wings of Hope are due to their contact with humans or human
  situations. Individuals are encourage not to disturb or interrupt wildlife;
  however, sometimes it is necessary to assist orphaned or rehabilitate injured
  wild animals in order to return them to their native habitat. We encourage
  individuals to resist the temptation of trying to make a pet of a wild animal.
  Allow our trained staff and volunteers to provide the necessary professional
  care to the wildlife in preparation for its future release to the
  wild.  Contact Wings of Hope if you discover an injured wild bird or mammal,
  have concerns regarding a possible orphaned wild bird or mammal, or have any
  questions."

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
